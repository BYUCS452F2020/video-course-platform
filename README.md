# Video Course Platform
We will be creating an open source video course management platform for those who want to develop courses for business, educational, or training may have a platform to do so. An admin will be able to log in, create courses, and give course-specific access to others. A user will be able to log in and view the video course.

## Team
I'm looking for one or two others to join the team.

## SQL
Most likely PostgreSQL, open to suggestions.

## NoSQL
Document based database. Want to dicuss different options.

## Business
This will be an open source project, so there will be minimal business interaction. Maintenance of the project will be open to contributors.

## Legal
N/A

## Technical
  1. Finalize SQL and NoSQL databases
  2. Finalize client-side and server-side languages (leaning towards React and Node.js)
  3. Determine hosting
  4. Implement the MVP
